Meteor and react work together.React is the library

Meteor ->just a place to keep javacript files. React is a third party library to meteor. Meteors also gives a web server.

To create project in meteor command=  "meteor create images"

To run server command="meteor"

"Npm registry" contains libraries we need

to install any dependency(now react) "meteor npm install --save react"

React is used to produce html and handle user events.

"client" folder is special in meteor , any code you want to execute is added in this folder. Any files put in this folder will run automatically

"main.html" file is automatically loaded by meteor when site is opened

A "component" is a single function or object which produces some html and shows it on screen

jsx is the code written in a component (html like code)

ReactDom is a library which works with the web browser "meteor npm install --save react-dom"

Whenver you want to reference javascript variable inside of jsx you do using curly braces

Passing some amount of data from parent component to chil component is known as props(property)

think of component as a class , you need to create a instance of it (object) to use in a function

ReactDOM.render is a method of the react-dom library-> has two arguments, first argument is a component to render(wrap the component with tags ), second argument is where you want to render the component to inside the DOm(use a native query selector which searches for the component through the DOm "document.querySelector(".container")")

Always wait for the dom to load before you add component to your project(Meteor.startup())


1)Three steps while  making component

- Import react
-Create our component(create function and return jsx)
-export our component (export default ImageList)

for our own files always provide the proper path while importing the component

Always import other components in your main component(main.js in this project)
ReactDOM.render is only used once for your root component. Other components are always imported in the main components

to import twitter bootstrap to meteor use "meteor add twbs:bootstrap@3.3.6"

in react we use "className" to add css classes instead of class

in es6 if in function there is only one line to return , you and take off the return key word and also the parenthesis

axios used to make ajax requests

axios.get("url")  ---to make ajax request

use classes to make your component fetch their own data

componentWillMount() is a method that gets called right before component will be loaded in your application

state is a property every component has. It is a javascript object that we can make changes to, and once any change is done to it ,the component will automatically re-render


this.setState is the only way we change our state over time. Only modify state object directly when you initialize it
